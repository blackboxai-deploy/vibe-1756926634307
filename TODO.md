# NADER E-commerce Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Structure ✅
- [x] Create main page structure (App Router)
- [x] Set up TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Create product data structure
- [x] Implement responsive layout

## Phase 2: Core Components Development
- [ ] **ProductCard component** - Enhanced product display with images
- [ ] **Cart component** - Shopping cart with add/remove functionality
- [ ] **Navigation component** - Header with logo and cart counter
- [ ] **Footer component** - Brand footer with social links
- [ ] **ProductGrid component** - Product showcase section

## Phase 3: E-commerce Functionality
- [ ] **Cart Context** - Global state management with localStorage
- [ ] **Product API** - Server-side product data management
- [ ] **Cart API** - Cart operations and persistence
- [ ] **Product detail pages** - Individual product pages

## Phase 4: Payment System (Modular Design)
- [ ] **Payment abstraction layer** - Easy provider switching
- [ ] **PayPal integration** (disabled by default)
- [ ] **Mock payment component** - Temporary checkout simulation
- [ ] **Payment configuration** - Environment-based payment setup

## Phase 5: Image Processing & Assets
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] **Logo creation** - Brand logo for header
- [ ] **Product images** - High-quality product photography

## Phase 6: Enhanced Features

- [ ] **Quantity selection** - Cart quantity management

## Phase 7: Build & Testing
- [ ] **Build application** - Production build with error handling
- [ ] **API testing** - Validate all endpoints with curl
- [ ] **Cart functionality testing** - Add/remove/update operations
- [ ] **Payment flow testing** - Mock payment simulation
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** - Cross-device compatibility

## Phase 8: Final Polish
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Image loading and caching
- [ ] **SEO optimization** - Meta tags and structured data
- [ ] **Error boundaries** - Proper error handling
- [ ] **Loading states** - Smooth user experience
- [ ] **Documentation** - Setup and payment provider instructions
